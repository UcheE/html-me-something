            <p> On August 17 2011, I started a global graduate program that allowed me to live in 5 different countries for two months each
(Holland, UK, Switzerland, Beijing , and Austria ) and visit 8 others (13 countries in one year CRAZY right!).
All year I wanted to start a blog and document what I was experiencing while actually experiencing it, but time did not permit me to do so.
You try going to four hour classes twice a week, writing 3,000-12,000 word papers each week, preparing for presentation, reading tons of scholarly
articles and book, going to seminars, trying to find time to enjoy the country you're living in and to sleep! Not an easy task, but definitely doable
- I MADE IT! But though I may not have the luxury to give an authentic recap of my adventures while in the moment, believe me some of those moments will
never be forgotten. I have learned so much from all the amazing people and picturesque place I visited and I will love to share them with you all. This
blog will not just be a trajectory of my journey but it will also be used to express my viewpoints, discuss self growth, and to revere some of the awesome individuals I met.
Stay tuned!!</p>
      <h2>Favorite Places!</h2>

        <p>Holland is such a charming, active town where everyone rides bikes. I've never seen so many bikes in one place. When I mean everyone rides bikes, I'm talking 80 year
old women; mother's with one child in the front and another in the back; and businessmen in their refined suits riding with one hand on the handlebar and the other holding their
briefcase. Bike riders basically own the roads. But besides the strong bike culture another awesome feature of Leiden was that the whole town sat alongside several small canals.
Here are some pics from a canal ride during the first week. Nice right?!</p>

        <p>    These are 4 truths that seem to transcend across country boarders.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>No one likes to feel like a foreigner, even when they're in a foreign country.</li>
                    <p>Feeling apart of something even in a foregin land, will make your experence so much better. When you are alone, your experience will be hollow.</p>
                <li>Humility is contagious.</li>
                    <p>A humble person understands that there are always other narratives to consider.</p>
                <li>The art of conversing is a powerful tool.</li>
                    <p>The power in converation is so rewarding because if you really listen to the other person, there is no way you won't learn something new.</p>
                <li>Learn to live free and fearlessly.</li>
                    <p>Traveling helps you with this because you have to learn to live outside your comfort zone.</p>
            </ol>
